Questions: 
  1) In testing, there seems to be a disconnect of structure between the test files and the actual templates.
  Any changes to templates would require the same structure to be re-coded in the test as well - so we are essentially duplicating code.
  These structural changes apply to both data and markup.
  Are there any alternatives to directly querying specific markup structure in testing? A shared configuration?
  Any alternatives to just making up dummy data in the test itself?
